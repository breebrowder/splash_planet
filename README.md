#  Custom Frontend From Scratch - SPLASH PLANET

![alt text](https://github.com/breebrowder/splash_planet/blob/Bree/images/planet.jpg)

## Project Info

You and your team have been contacted by a local, elusive, client. They have a new product and they need a responsive website built for them in order to market it online; they know you’ve got just the right skill set to craft their vision. Secretive as they are, they have decided to NOT give you details about their company, nor give you details on the product they are selling. Instead, they hand over to you a simple sentence, which they want you to interpret, in order to build the best possible responsive website for them to use as a marketing tool. The sentence they give you is:

* “Waves”

## TASKS

### 0. Building The Site

You and your team are tasked with the following:

1. Build a 1-3 page website for the product you believe they are selling based on their prompt
2. Your website must be locally hosted
3. Your website must integrate at least 3 of the following components (some of these you’ve seen before - others you may need to research more)
   * CSS Framework(s) (e.g. Bootstrap, Semantic UI, etc.)
   * JavaScript framework(s)
   * Utilizing a third-party API
   * A backend with a storage system
   * CSS Preprocessor
   * Accessibility

### 1. Client Pitch
You and your team must pitch your website to this elusive client. They refuse to meet with you in person or online - instead, they insist that you send them a document selling them on why YOUR website is the one to pick for their new product.

Your pitch must include the following:

* Tell a story about why your solution is the best for the product you believe they are selling
* Explain why you chose to integrate specific components
* Describe the development difficulties and how you overcame them, ultimately making their site stronger
* A summary, including any final thoughts as to why this client should pick your website for their online marketing needs
